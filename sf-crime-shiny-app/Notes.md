###Data source

The crime data was obtained from [SF Open Data](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Map-Crime-Incidents-from-1-Jan-2003/gxxq-x39z/data)

### Basic usage

Either type a location's address or click on the map to obtain results in a radius around that location.
You can further filter the data by crime category, day of week, or period of the day.
You can also [facet](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Facets_(ggplot2)/) the plots by category, day, or period.

### Map tab

The map tab displays all the reported crimes according to the options selected on the left panel. The map is initially centered at a location chosen at random from a set of landmarks and intersections.

Zooming in and clicking on an individual marker will show the address, description, and date and time of the incident.

### Data tab

Here you can view the results 25 at a time, as well as interactively filter and search and sort them. 

### Bar plots tab

The bar plots (and the density maps) are faceted according to the input selection. In order to keep the tables readable, the top crime categories are used.

The following shows a result of crimes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays that took place during the early morning and evening time periods, faceted by day of the week

The same set of results, now faceted by time of day

### Density maps tab

The density maps take a few seconds to display. They are faceted similarly to the bar plots

### Table tab

The table depicts a 3-way contingency table. The variables (category, day of the week, and period of the day) are also arranged depending on the facets chosen on the left panel.
